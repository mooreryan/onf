# Ruby-like C

A library functions that behave more or less like their Ruby counterparts.

The unit tests have all their expected outputs generated by calls to the Ruby methods that the C functions are based on so that whatever value you'd get in Ruby you should also get with these C functions.

Uses the [Better String Library](https://github.com/websnarf/bstrlib) internally.

## Documentation

Doxygen API docs [here](https://mooreryan.github.io/ruby_like_c/).


## Development

Clone the repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mooreryan/ruby_like_c.git
```

Make some dirs.

```
$ cd ruby_like_c && mkdir bin test/support
```

Install `ceedling`.

```
$ gem install ceedling
```

### Testing

We use `ceedling` to run the unit tests.  It's snazzy.

Most of the unit tests are based on those for the Ruby source code, e.g., [these](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/e6ad53beaa8f61c784d7e6c9cace5bd6ecc4d5c8/test/ruby/test_file_exhaustive.rb).

Because we want the functions to give the same values as their Ruby counterparts, some of the tests files should generated automatically like so:

```
$ ruby scripts/generate_tests.rb
```

This should dump some files in the `test` directory.

Then you can run the test suite with the `ceedling` command.
